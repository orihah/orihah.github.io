<h2>Champions of the Light</h2>

<p>
	For this fight on all 3 difficulties our team currently uses a ZERG strategy as noted in the fight description.  This means DPS will ignore adds other than to interrupt Angelic Renewal.
	Healers may also need to save cooldowns for the end of the fight.

<p>
	The main difference on mythic here is that 2 adds spawn and each drops on orb on death.  We currently have a single DPS handling the orbs, to do this we must ensure
	that the second add dies around the same time the first orb is taken.  We use the orbs primarly during the bosses Tank mechanic to prevent raid damage.

<p>
	The main element to remember here is that all but 2 people, 1 healer and 1 tank, will be pulled into the sky to complete Multi-sided Strike. 
	During this each player will be placed in the center of a circle and 5 enemies will appear around the circle in sequence, kicking through the character 
	after a short time. The player must be facing the monk when it kicks or take high damage.  The color order of the monks is the same each time, Blue Green Red Green Blue.
	We will also assign orbs to specific players for the guantlet phase, if you are assigned a orb famaliarize yourself with its placement.

<h2>Opulence</h2>

<p>
The main difficulty to this fight is that all dps must learn both hallways, as they will be swapped back and forth throughout the fight.  To make each room easier orbs and lasers should be positioned
around the outside of the room.  Learning the duration and speed of Flames of Punishment will also make survivabilty much easier.  Any deaths during the hallway phase  of the 
fight is almost always a cause for a wipe.  DPS must be close to even for each hallway, as each side must reach its gem room within a similar timeframe to allow healers 
to deal with Theif's Bane.

<h2>Conclave of the Chosen</h2>

<p>
The only significant change to this fight on mythic is that a curse is placed on random characters throughout the fight.  The curse Bwonsamdi's Wrath prevents the 
cursed player from receiving any healing and when it is removed it moves to a new character. By the end of the fight there will be 5-6 of these debuffs cycling 
throughout the raid.  As the only classes that can remove curses are Druids, Shamans and Mages, we recommend that ALL players of these classes download 
<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/decursive">Decursive</a> this addon will assist in removing the curse.  Only removing when the player is low health or 
during Paku's Wrath.
